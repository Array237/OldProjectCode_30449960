# OldProjectCode_30449960 Production

# Description

# This was our group project for CMPG 223 in 2021.
# We had to design a program for cafeteria to make its odering system somewhat online.
# So we used ASP.NET and visual code to write the program and used mainly C3 to wite the program.
# I also had to teach myself some HTML and CSS to design the webpagesand also write most of the C#.
# We were a group of five but just two of us endded up taking it serious, had a coding session that went all night 
# and to this day i always say i wont mind doing  it again because the rush of problem soliving with code is something else.
